            The four kinds of react state to manage. Local state , global state
            , server state, and last one URL state.Local state is easy to
            manage. Try to use those hooks to manage local state they are
            useState, useCallback, useReducer. To manage global state in react
            those hooks are very usefull they are useReducer, useContext. To
            manage server state you should use useState with useEffect. And last
            one to manage url state you can useHistory or useLocation.

            This prototypical inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
            methods and properties in objects. Its is a method by which an
            object can inherit the properties and methods of another object in
            order to get and set the prototype of an object we use object

              Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if
              you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do
              not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts

            If we directly update the state it doesn't change the state
            immediately. In this case it creates a pending state transition and
            accessing it after calling this method will only return the present
            value we will lose control of the state across all components.

            Purpose of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and
            determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step
            in the development process, because if done correctly it can help
            detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in
            later testing stage.
